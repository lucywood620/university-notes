consultations?

\end{itemize}
\textit{In a group project you think you’ve invented the ultimate super
rucksack every student needs; what aspects of it are you going to want
to protect and where and how? }
\begin{itemize}
	\item Patent any unique features

\end{itemize}
\textit{In the case study there are high sums and high issues at stake. The
authors ask: “1) did patents spur technological innovation, and 2) did the
intellectual property constraints of PCR affect its dissemination?” (Fore
et al, 2006: 12) Discuss. }\\
Did patents spur technological innovation?:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Potentially, they mean that all the effort going into research can be exploited by the same company, rather than another company getting all the research and development for free
	\item However by protecting it, there can be no further development to it, apart from by the same company, limiting innovation
\end{itemize}
Did IP constraints of PCR affect its dissemination:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Statistics suggest not, however it is difficult to tell, as it can only be compared to other non protected items
\end{itemize}
