\section{Conditional Probability}
Let E and F be events and let p(F) $>$ 0. The conditional probability of E given
F, denoted p(E|F) is
$$p ( E | F ) = \frac { p ( E \cap F ) } { p ( F ) }$$
Intuition: if we assume F, we make F the new sample space, and then apply the
usual definition of probability.
\subsection{Examples}
\subsubsection{Example 1}
What is the probability that a randomly generated 4-bit string has two consecutive 0s if we know that the first bit is 0?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sample space S: all 4-bit strings, S = $2^4$ = 16
	\item Event E: 4-bit string has two consecutive 0s
	\item Event F: first bit is 0
	\item We know that $p ( E | F ) = p ( E \cap F ) / p ( F )$
	\item $E\cap F$ consists of strings 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100. So $p(E \cap F)$ = 5/16 
	\item $p ( F ) = 8 / 16 = 1 / 2 , \text { so } p ( E | F ) = p ( E \cap F ) / p ( F ) = \frac { 5 / 16 } { 1 / 2 } = 5 / 8$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Example 2}
What is the probability that a family with two children has two boys, given that they have at least one boy? Assume that all possibilities BB, GG, BG, and GB are equally likely

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sample space S: the 4 combinations abov
	\item Event E: BB
	\item Event F: BB, GB, BG
	\item $\text { We know that } p ( E | F ) = p ( E \cap F ) / p ( F )$
	\item $\text { Event } E \cap F : B B . \text { So } p ( E \cap F ) = 1 / 4$
	\item $p ( F ) = 3 / 4 , \text { so } p ( E | F ) = p ( E \cap F ) / p ( F ) = \frac { 1 / 4 } { 3 / 4 } = 1 / 3$
\end{itemize}
\section{Independence}
\begin{itemize}
	\item One can say that event E is independent from F if p ( E ) = p ( E | F )
	\item Since $p ( E | F ) = p ( E \cap F ) / p ( F )$, we have
\end{itemize}
$$ p ( E ) = p ( E | F ) \text { iff } p ( E \cap F ) = p ( E ) p ( F )$$
\end{document}
\subsection{Definition}
The events E and F are independent if $p ( E \cap F ) = p ( E ) p ( F )$
