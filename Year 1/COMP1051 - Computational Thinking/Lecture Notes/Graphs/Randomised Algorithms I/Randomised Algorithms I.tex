\section{Deterministic algorithms}
The algorithms we saw until now are deterministic:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Process the input and produce an output
	\item If it runs many times with the same input it produced the same output
	\item For many "hard" computational problems
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is difficult to design efficient algorithms
		\item or the running time is very high
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Where is the difficulty:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We often need to make choices between two (or more) alternatives
	\item to make a correct choice we often need to know many \textbf{structural parameters} of the input
	\item decisions in \textbf{previous} steps may influence the range of choices in future steps
\end{itemize}
What can we do for that?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Design efficient heuristics:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item They run quickly
		\item But do not always compute the optimum solution
	\end{itemize}
	\item Design approximation algorithms
	\begin{itemize}
		\item an optimum solution is not guaranteed
		\item but it is guaranteed that their output is "not far" from the optimum (small approximation ratio)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Use randomisation
\end{itemize}
\section{Randomised algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
	\item An algorithm is randomised if its behaviour (output, running time) is determined by:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The input and
		\item The values produced by a random generator (correspond to the random choices that it makes)
	\end{itemize}
	\item If it runs many times with the same input: it has different outputs/running times (depending on the random values each time)
\end{itemize}
\section{Randomised numbers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The procedure $RANDOM(a,b)$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item returns an integer between a and b
		\item each of then with equal probability
		\item every call of RANDOM is independent from the other ones
	\end{itemize}
	\item In practice: real randomness is difficult
	\begin{itemize}
		\item we use pseudo-random number generators
		\item deterministic algorithms returning number that \textbf{look random}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
An application of RANDOM(a,b)
\begin{itemize}
	\item We are given a graph G with vertices 1.2,...,n
	\item We want to compute the random distance of a pair of vertices in G
\end{itemize}
Recall
\begin{itemize}
	\item The algorithm BFS(G,a,b) computes the distance between the vertices a and b in G
	\item The randomised algorithm:
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Random\_Distance(G)]
a=RANDOM(1,n) £\hfill£ // randomly choose the first vertex a
b=a £\hfill£ // initialization
while b=a
	b=RANDOM(1,n) £\hfill£ // randomly choose the second vertex 
return BFS(G,a,b) £\hfill£ //coompute the distance of a and b
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
Another application of RANDOM(a,b)
\begin{itemize}
	\item We are given an array A with n numbers
	\item we want to permute its elements randomly
\end{itemize}
How can we do that
\begin{itemize}
	\item Key idea
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Assign each element A[i] of the array A with a "priority" P[i]
		\item Then sort the elements of A according to these priorities
	\end{itemize}
	\item The randomised algorithm:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Permute-By-Sorting(A)]
n $\leftarrow$ length[A]
for i $\leftarrow$ 1 to n
	do P[i]=RANDOM($1,n^3$)
sort A using P as sort keys
return A
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
\section{Randomised algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In a randomised algorithm:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The input is \textbf{not} randomly chosen: only the decisions of the algorithm
		\item The running time may depend on its random choices. We calculate the "expected running time"
	\end{itemize}

\section{Basic probability notions}
In a random experiment (e.g. a coin toss):
\begin{itemize}
	\item First we define a sample space S
	\item Each subset of S is an event
	\item Each single element of S is also an elementary events (elementary events are also events)
	\item We assign to each elementary event $x\in S$ a number $Pr(x)\geqslant 0$\\
	Such that for every event $A=\{x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_k\}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\operatorname { Pr } ( A ) = \operatorname { Pr } \left( x _ { 1 } \right) + \operatorname { Pr } \left( x _ { 2 } \right) + \operatorname { Pr } \left( x _ { 3 } \right) + \ldots + \operatorname { Pr } \left( x _ { k } \right)$
		\item Pr(S)=1 i.e.S is the certain event
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The probability of an event shows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How probable is that the experiment has an outcome
	\item For two events A and B, if $A\cap B=\varnothing$, then
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A and B are called \textbf{mutually exclusive} and
		\item $Pr(A\cup B)=Pr(A)+Pr(B)$
	\end{itemize}
	\item Two events A and B are independent if:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $Pr(A\cap B)=Pr(A)\cdot Pr(B)$
	\end{itemize}
	\item In general we consider A and B as independent if they correspond to random experiments defined on different time and space domains
\end{itemize}
E.g for the random experiment "two independent tosses of a 'fair' coin":
\begin{itemize}
	\item The sample space: $S = \{ H H , H T , T H , T T \}$
	\item The event "one head and one tail is":
	$$A=\{HT,TH\}$$
and has probability
$$Pr(A)=Pr(HT)+Pr(TH)$$
$$=\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}$$
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A random variable X is a function from S to the real numbers
	\item The expected value of X is 
	$$E[X]=\sum_{x\in \mathbb{R}} x\cdot Pr(\{X=x\})$$
\end{itemize}
E.g for the experiment "toss two 'fair' coins":
\begin{itemize}
	\item You earn £3 for each head but lose £2 for every tail
	\item The random variable is X="your earnings"
	\item The expected value of X is:
	$$E [ X ] = 6 \cdot P ( H H ) + ( 3 - 2 ) \cdot P ( \{ H T , T H \} ) - 4 \cdot P ( T T )= 6 \cdot ( 1 / 4 ) + 1 \cdot ( 1 / 4 + 1 / 4 ) - 4 \cdot ( 1 / 4 ) = 1$$
\end{itemize}
Theorem: for any two random variables X and Y, the expected value of the random variable X+Y is
$$E[X+Y]=E[X]+E[Y]$$
\begin{itemize}
	\item This property is called "linearity of expectation"
	\item It is particularly useful for applications
\end{itemize}
\section{Randomised algorithms}
Two main types of randomised algorithms
\begin{itemize}
	\item Las Vegas algorithms
	\begin{itemize}
		\item always find the correct solution
		\item the running time varies for every execution
	\end{itemize}
	\item Monte Carlo algorithms
	\begin{itemize}
		\item not always the correct solution
		\item but we can bound the probability of an incorrect solution
	\end{itemize}
	\item Both very useful depending on the application
\end{itemize}
\section{Monte Carlo algorithms}
For decision problems (answer is YES/NO), there are two kinds of Monte Carlo algorithms
\begin{itemize}
	\item Algorithms with two-sided error:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item there is a non zero probability that the answer is wrong, when it answers YES and when it answers NO
	\end{itemize}
	\item Algorithms with one-sided error:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item there is a non zero probability that the answer is wrong, when it answers NO
		\item the answer is always correct, when it answers YES
		\item if we run the algorithm repeatedly:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item the failure probability becomes very small
			\item the running time increases
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{One sided error}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You have two £1 coins
	\item Bob claims that the first one is real and the second is fake
	\item You want to verify Bob's claim:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item So you ask hum questions
		\item what do you ask
	\end{itemize}
	\item Main idea:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item if the coins are not the same, you finally believe Bob
		\item if the coins are the same, you will catch Bob lying
	\end{itemize}
	\item A Monte-Carlo algorithm:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Put the coins behind your back
		\item Pick one randomly (you know which one you have picked)
		\item ask Bob whether the picked coin is real or fake
	\end{itemize}
	\item Why does it work
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the coins are different Bob will always recognise the fake one
		\item If the coins are the same:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In this case, Bob lies
			\item He does not know which one you picked
			\item he will guess $\Rightarrow$ he answers incorrectly with probability $\frac{1}{2}$
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Our decision is "does Bob lie?"
\begin{itemize}
	\item if you answer YES
	\begin{itemize}
		\item then you caught Bob lying
		\item $\Rightarrow$ you are sure he lies (always correct YES answer)
	\end{itemize}
	\item If you answer NO
	\begin{itemize}
		\item then you did not catch Bob lying
		\item $\Rightarrow$ either he is honest, or he was just lucky (erroneous NO answer with probability $\frac{1}{2}$)
	\end{itemize}
	\item If you repeat the experiment k times:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You give an erroneous NO answer with probability $\frac{1}{2^k}$ i.e. if he is too lucky (all k times)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The graph isomorphism problem: "given two graphs $G_1,G_2$, are they the same graph?
	\item A hard problem - nobody knows whether an efficient algorithm exists
	\item If Bob claims that $G_1$ and $G_2$ are not the same
	\begin{itemize}
		\item randomly pick one of the graphs
		\item ask Bob whether this is $G_1$ or $G_2$
		\item similar idea with the coins
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
$\Rightarrow$ we have a Monte Carlo algorithm with one-sided error for the problem "graph non-isomorphism"
