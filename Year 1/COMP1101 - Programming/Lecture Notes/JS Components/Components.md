# Javascript Objects


## Collection of properties

Each property is named (with a key) and has a value

In Javascript Object Notation (JSON) we can write

```
let ball = {x: 200, y: 300, radius: 50};
```


## obj.prop

Access and properties like this

```
ellipse(ball.x, ball.y, ball.radius*2, ball.radius*2);
ball.x += 5;
ball.z = 8;
ball["colour"] = "red";

```


## Function-valued properties

Object properties can be any type, including functions

```
ball.draw = function(){ alert("I am a ball");}
ball.draw();
```


## this

`this` refers to the object it was called on

```
ball.draw = function(){
	  ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.radius*2, this.radius*2);
	  }
ball.draw();

```


## Prototypal Inheritance

- Every object has a property `__proto__` which refers to another object
- If a property isn't found in an object's own properties, then `__proto__` is checked
- Every function has a property `prototype` which can be used when creating an object
- The `new` keyword is used with a constructor function to create an object and set its `__proto__`

## Inheriting behaviour

- In other languages (e.g Java, C#) every object belongs to a *class*
    - Data values (fields) are associated with objects
    - Behaviour (methods) are associated with classes
- Things of the same type (class) can do the same things
- JS is more flexible: each object can define its own behaviour
- JS allows inheritance (common behaviour) through prototypes


- Java uses *class-based inheritance*
- JS use *prototypal inheritance*



## Emulating classes in JS

[Simple syntax for constructors and prototype functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

```
class Ball{
   constructor(x, y, r){
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
      this.radius = r;
   }
   draw(){
      ellipse(this.x, this.y,
         this.radius*2, this.radius*2);
      }
}
let b = new Ball(400,300,20);
b.draw();

```


## Why classes?

- Reduces cut-and-paste: eases maintenance
- Encourages *encapsulation*: hide the details so they can be changed easily
- Make reusable compoments with classes
- Reuse in the same project (multiple balls) or in different projects
