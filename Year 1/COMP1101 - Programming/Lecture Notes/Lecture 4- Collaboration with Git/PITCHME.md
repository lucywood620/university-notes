## Working together

- git supports collaboration
- It is a tool not a method
- Need to think about collaboration method

## Questions to ask

@ul
- Where to host remote repos (one or many)?
- Who has control over the remote (one or many)?
- How will you decide and allocate tasks
- How will you know if the tasks are complete?
- (How) will you make a release?

Options include:

1. One person approves changes, others make pull requests (fork?)
2. One person owns the repository, others are collaborators
3. Collaborators form an organization for multiple projects

Outside of scope of version control. Options include:

1. spreadsheet

## Making a release

- Move/copy to public_html (clone, pull)
- Branching: master and develop
- Feature branching

- Release vs continuous delivery/deployment
