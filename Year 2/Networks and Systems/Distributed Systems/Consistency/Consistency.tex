\underline{\huge Concurrent events and consistency control}
\end{center}
\section{Concurrency}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Shared Object} - May be simultaneously accessed by multiple events
	\item A server which manages shared objects is responsible for ensuring the objects remain consistent when accessed by concurrent events
	\item Such a control is called concurrency control
\end{itemize}
Extension to replication - If event T happens before event U in their conflicting access to objects at one of the servers then they must be in that order at all of the servers whose objects are accessed in a conflicting manner by both T and U
\section{Locking}
Grant a lock
\begin{itemize}
	\item Locks on an object are held (in a server) locally
	\item Local lock manager can decide whether to grant a lock or make the requesting transaction wait
\end{itemize}
Issues with Distributed Transmission (DT)
\begin{itemize}
	\item A DT acquires resource located at different servers
	\item Can't release any locks until the transaction has been committed or aborted at all servers involved in the transaction
	\item Objects remain locked and are unavailable for all other transactions during the atomic commit protocol
\end{itemize}
\section{Timestamp ordering}
Timestamp:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assign a timestamp to each transaction when it starts
	\item Serial equivalence is enforced by committing the versions of objects in the order of the timestamps of transactions that accessed them
	\item Requirement: Globally unique timestamps
\end{itemize}
Distributed Transaction:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Servers of distributed transactions are jointly responsible for ensuring that they are performed in a serially equivalent manner
	\item To achieve the same ordering at all the servers, the coorinators must agree as to the ordering of their timestamps
	\item Issue - In practice, a timestamp is usually assigned by a local server, generating a timestamp, server id pair
\end{itemize}
\section{Concurrent Operations}
In a single machine:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Concurrent operations (events), no matter originated from different or the same machine, are handled by the time sharing feature of an operating system
	\item Operations are implicitly executed one by one in a series under a single clock, i.e. order of operations is well-defined
\end{itemize}
In a distributed system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Concurrent operations may run on different machines, i.e. distributed transactions
	\item Order of operations can't be easily sorted out due to overlapping operations, clock synchronisation problems, network latency and message loss etc
\end{itemize}
