\underline{\huge Introduction}
\end{center}
\begin{defin}[Distributed Systems]
	A collection of independent components, including
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hardware
		\item Software Components
		\item Web services
	\end{itemize}
	Which work together and appear to its users as a single coherent system
\end{defin}
\section{Comparison}
Networks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Focus: method and implementation of communication
	\item Data transmission: addressing, scheduling, quality control and error recovery
\end{itemize}
Distributed Systems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Components: heterogeneous (OS, H/W, S/W), physically loosely coupled, but are required to collaborate
	\item System architecture: transparency, performance, reliability
	\item Network technology: means to connect and organise DS components
\end{itemize}
\section{Applications of distributed systems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Rapid system development, reuse existing components or services
	\item Construct low cost and scalable system: link up many low cost machines to work together as a coherent system
	\item Improve system reliability or availability: based on redundant components
\end{itemize}
\section{Design issues}
Network issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Highly variable bandwidth
	\item Possibly large and variable latency
\end{itemize}
Distributed event issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item No native support to clock synchronization among hosts
	\item Difficult to ensure data consistency
\end{itemize}
System failure issue:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Unpredictable failures of components, may be due to failure of a network component or communication delay incurred on the communication path
\end{itemize}
Security issues
\begin{itemize}
	\item Centralized systems:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can rely on physical security
		\item Users understand what trust to assign to the system
		\item System administrators are responsible
	\end{itemize}
	\item Distributed systems:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item None of the above applies
		\item Hard to know what is being trusted or what can be trusted
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Transparency requirement}
Hide the separation of components or their organisation and changes\\
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|}
	\hline
	Types of transparency& Description\\
	\hline
	Access& Hide differences in data representations and how a component is accessed\\
	\hline
	Location& Hide where a component is located\\
	\hline
	Migration&Hide that a component or a resource may move to another location(content distribution network)\\
	\hline
	Relocation& Hide that a component or a resource may be moved to another location while in use (caching)\\
	\hline
	Replication& Hide that a component or a resource may have multiple copies(provide fast or local access)\\
	\hline
	Concurrency&Hide that a resource may be shared by several competitive users(handle shared resources)\\
	\hline
	Failure&Hide the failure and recovery of a resource or a component\\
