\section{Elements of a wireless network}
Wireless hosts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Laptop, smartphone
	\item Run applications
	\item May be stationary or mobile
\end{itemize}
Base station:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Typically connected to wired network
	\item Relay - responsible for sending packets between wired network and wireless host(s) in its "area" 
\end{itemize}
Wireless link:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Typically used to connect mobile(s) to base station
	\item Also used as backbone link
	\item Multiple access protocol coordinates link access
	\item Various data rates, transmission distances
\end{itemize}
Infrastructure mode:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Base station connects mobiles into wired network
	\item Handoff: mobile changes base station providing connection into wired network
\end{itemize}
Ad hoc mode:
\begin{itemize}
	\item No base stations
	\item Nodes can only transmit to other nodes within link coverage
	\item Nodes organize themselves into a network: route among themselves
\end{itemize}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline 
	Standard & Frequency Range & Data Rate \\ 
	\hline 
	802.11b & 2.4 GHz & Up to 11 Mbps \\ 
	\hline 
	802.11a & 5 GHz & Up to 54 Mbps \\ 
	\hline 
	802.11g & 2.4 GHz & Up to 54 Mbps \\ 
	\hline 
	802.11n & 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz & Up to 450 Mbps \\ 
	\hline 
	802.11ac & 5GHz & Up to 1300 Mbps \\

\section{Wireless Link Characteristics}
Important differences from wired link
\begin{itemize}
	\item Decreased signal strength: radio signal attenuates as it propagates through matter
	\item Interference from other sources: standardized wireless network frequencies shared by other devices interfere as well
	\item Multipath propagation: radio signal reflects off object ground, arriving at destination at slightly different times
\end{itemize}
Make communication across a wireless link much more difficult
\begin{defin}[Hidden terminals]
Senders that cannot sense each other but nonetheless collide at intended receiver
\end{defin}
Multiple wireless senders and receivers create additional problems (beyond multiple access)\\

Hidden terminal problem
\begin{itemize}
	\item B,A hear each other
	\item B,C hear each other
	\item A,C can't hear each other, means A,C unaware of their interference at B 
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{"signal attenuation"}\\
Signal attenuation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item B,A hear each other
	\item B,C hear each other
	\item A,C can't hear each other interfering at B
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\begin{defin}[Exposed terminals]
Senders who can sense each other but still transmit safely (to different receivers)
\end{defin}
