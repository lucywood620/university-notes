\section{Who really are the adversaries?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Professional criminal gangs

	\item Database breach
	\item Botnets, fast flux, domain flux
	\item Spam
	\item Keyloggers
	\item Rootkits
	\item Man in the browser
\end{itemize}
\section{The economy}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bitcoin transactions change cyber landscape by enabling anonymous transactions

	\item Hacker steals 1000 Fullz (credit card and CCV and name and address)
	\item Sells on Tor forum for 1 BTC
	\item Buyer sells groups of 20 to cashiers
\end{itemize}
\section{Planning strategies}
With the advent of machine learning, strategies are more intelligent based on large scale analytics
\begin{itemize}
	\item Open source intelligence (OSINT)
	\item Sentiment analysis
	\item Targeted advertising
	\item Identifying criminals and threats
\end{itemize}
\section{Spies - Can "we" stay anonymous}
VPNs can be used to hide your IP address, or TOR can be used to increase anonymity
\section{Security Operations Center (SOCs)}
Teams proactively monitor the infrastructure\\
\\
Tools/communities:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Alien Vault
	\item Snort
	\item SNAIL
	\item OSEC
	\item OTX
	\item Logrhythm
\end{itemize}
\section{Security Information and Event Management}
Third party monitoring (Â£8k/year)\\
Log rhythm:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create rules for alert types
	\item People review alerts and report back
	\item Cost depends on the level of monitoring they want
\end{itemize}
\section{High Availability Pair}
2 firewalls in active-active pair (means e.g. VOIP availability during updates) Network/switches updated out of hours
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Verify HA functionality before an upgrade
\end{enumerate}
