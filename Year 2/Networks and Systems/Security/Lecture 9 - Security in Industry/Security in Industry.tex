\underline{\huge Security in Industry}
\end{center}
Trade off between:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Security
\end{itemize}
and
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cost
	\item Convenience
	\item Usability
\end{itemize}
\section{Security in Large Corporations}
Locked down environments:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Software has to be pre-vetted before being installed
	\item Often will have VMs/OS images with everything setup
	\item Network policies will be very strict
\end{itemize}
General security policies
\begin{itemize}
	\item Need to have badge and swipe everywhere you go
	\item Very secure areas will be monitored/locked down
	\item Usually very locked down by default - need to escalate to managers to get approval
	\item Clean desk policy
	\item Heavy monitoring of production servers
\end{itemize}
Laptop security policies
\begin{itemize}
	\item Screen locks
	\item Encrypted HDD
	\item Kensington locks
	\item Monitoring software
\end{itemize}
\section{Attacks on Large Corporations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Out of date software
	\item Exploit single server running software with security flaw
	\item Social engineering
\end{itemize}
\section{Best practices}
\subsection{Login credentials}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use strong hash function for passwords
	\item Salt passwords
	\item Secure your email and password database
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No outside access
		\item Limit who can access this server
		\item Encrypt if possible
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{MFA}
Pick at least 2 from:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Something you know
	\item Something you have
	\item Something you are
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Web Dev}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add SRI checks on all 3rd party resources
	\item Keep software up to date
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is very important
		\item Build in time to do this in estimates
		\item OS deps, language, frameworks - all are important
	\end{itemize}
	\item Use well maintained framework for web development
	\item Limit what users can upload
	\begin{itemize}
		\item XSS attacks
		\item SQL injections
		\item CSRF attacks
	\end{itemize}
	\item Never execute input from user directly
	\item Use a strongly typed language
	\item Keep it simple
\end{itemize}
\section{AWS Security}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Port scanning is a good idea
	\item Security Groups allow for good security
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Clump nodes together
		\item Connection-oriented (only have to allow outbound for outbound TCP request)
	\end{itemize}
	\item VPCs are complex but powerful
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Network-level security
		\item Now even work between AWS regions
	\end{itemize}
	\item IAM profiles are very useful for security
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Only give access to particular resources
	\end{itemize}
	\item Use ELBs/ALBs with HTTPS enabled
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Simple to setup and performant
		\item Scales automatically
		\item No need to deal with certs in application
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Software Dependencies}
Trust and package managers
\begin{itemize}
	\item System packages vs programming language packages, which is safer?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GPG checks ensure that package you download was uploaded by maintainer
		\item Usually system packages have to go through rigorous vetting process
		\item Linux has been decades ahead of windows and mac os on this front
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Anti-patterns}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Automatic minor version updates
	\item Depending on a lot of packages
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each dependent package is a liability
	\end{itemize}
	\item Using packages which are no longer actively maintained
	\item Installing dependencies directly on servers:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is bad for speed and security
		\item Instead: bundle up dependencies with app using package/container/system image
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Personal Security: Best practices}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use 2FA
	\item Use secure apps
	\item Use a password manager
	\item Use TOR/SSH tunneling if you are on an unsafe connection
	\item Use an ad blocker
	\item Use Linux
	\item Go to conferences
\end{itemize}
