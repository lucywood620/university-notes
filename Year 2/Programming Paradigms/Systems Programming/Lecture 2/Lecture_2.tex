\underline{\huge Control Flow and Functions}
\end{center}
\section{Arrays}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You can use arrays to store multiple values of the same type
\end{itemize}
\begin{minted}{c}
int a[6] = {2,4,7,1,2,4}
\end{minted}
\section{True/False Comparison}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Traditionally, C did not have boolean types and just used ints
	\item Comparisons will evaluate to 1 if they hold and 0 if they don't
	\item C99 introduced bool, which is defined in \texttt{stdbool.h}
\end{itemize}
\section{Statements and compound statements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A statement in C is a single instruction terminated with a semicolon
	\begin{minted}{c}
	printf("Hello World!\n");
	\end{minted}
	\item A compound statement is a set of statements surrounded by a pair of curly brackets \{\}
	\begin{minted}{c}
	{
	printf("Hello ");
	printf("world!\n");
	}
	\end{minted}
	\item You can always replace a statement with a compound statement
	\item C doesn't care about formatting - but we need it!
\end{itemize}
\section{Some Style Conventions}
Compound statement:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Curly brackets on own lines
	\item Indent body with 2/4 characters or a tab
\end{itemize}
Variable names:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Constants - all capitals: MAX, PI
	\item \#defines - all capitals: DEBUG
	\item Normal variables
	\begin{itemize}
		\item camel case: myAge
		\item or snake cake: my\_age
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Comments
\begin{minted}{c}
/* This is a comment
that can go on multiple lines */
// This is a single line comment
\end{minted}
\section{Iteration Statements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item C's iteration statements are used to create loops
	\item A loop is a statement whose job is to repeatedly execute other statements: the loop body
	\item In C, every loop has a controlling expression
	\item Each time the loop body is executes, the expression is evaluated
	\item If the expression is true (has a non zero value), the loop continues to execute
\end{itemize}
C provides three iteration statements
\begin{itemize}
	\item The while statement is used for loops whose controlling expression is tested before the loop body is executed
	\begin{minted}{c}
while (a> 100) {...}
	\end{minted}
	\item The do statement is used if the expression is tested after the loop body is executed
\begin{minted}{c}
do {...} while (a>100);
\end{minted}
	\item The for statement is convenient for loops that increment or decrement a counting variable
\begin{minted}{c}
for (a = 199; a>100; a = a-1) {...}
\end{minted}
\end{itemize}
\section{The break and continue statements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The break; statement causes the innermost enclosing loop (or switch) to be exited immediately
\begin{minted}{c}
for(n = 10; n<=10; n++){
	statement(s)
	break; // or continue;
}
\end{minted}
	\item continue; causes the next iteration for the loop to begin (it does not apply to switch)
	\item In the case of a while or do loop, the test part is executed immediately; in the case of a for loop, control first passes to the increment step
	\item In a do while, continue will evaluate before looping round
\end{itemize}
\section{The if-else statement}
\begin{minted}{c}
if (expr1){
	statement1
}else{
	statement2
}
\end{minted}
\subsection{Cascaded if statements}
Allows testing of a series of conditions
\begin{minted}{c}
if(boolean_expression1) {
/* Executes when the boolean expression 1 is true */
} else if( boolean_expression2) {
/* Executes when the boolean expression 2 is true */
} else if( boolean_expression3) {
/* Executes when the boolean expression 3 is true */
} else {
/* executes when the none of the above condition is true */
}
\end{minted}
\section{Static program checking}
Using the wall (all warnings) flag on the compiler will make static checks e.g. for
\begin{minted}{c}
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
	int x = 0;
	if(x=0){ printf("x is 0\n");}
	return 0;
}
\end{minted}
This doesn't give the correct output as there is an assignment in the if statement, which equates to zero, which is equivalent to false, and so the if statement passes


\section{The switch statement}
This has the form
\begin{minted}{c}
switch(expression){
	case const-expr: statements
	case const-expr: statements
	default: statements
}
\end{minted}
Warning: if there is no break statement, execution falls through - all the cases will be executed
\section{Incrementing etc}
C has many methods of incrementing and decrementing
\begin{minted}{c}
++
--
+=
-=
*=
/=
%=
\end{minted}
x++: Evaluates to x, then adds one\\
++x: Adds one, then evaluates to x (so +1)\\
\\
In a for loop it doesn't matter which one you use
\section{Functions}
\subsection{Declaration}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Functions encapsulate code in a convenient way
	\item Analogous to methods in an O-O language
	\item Functions can be declared before they are defined, as a function declaration:
	\begin{minted}{c}
return-type function-name (paramenters);
	\end{minted}
	\item E.g. to calculate base raise to the power n
\begin{minted}{c}
int power(int base, int n);
\end{minted}
	\item Often we put these in a header file (.h)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Definition}
Functions can be defined anywhere in a program wile, if the declaration precedes use of the function
\begin{minted}{c}
int power (int base, int n) {
	int p;
	for ( p=1; n>0; n--)
		p=p*base
	return p;
}
\end{minted}
\subsection{Call by value}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Function parameters in C are passed using a call by value semantic
	\begin{minted}{c}
result = power(x,y);
	\end{minted}
	\item Here when x and y are passed through to \texttt{power()}, the values of x \& y are copied to the base and n variables in the function
	\item A function cannot affect the value of its arguments
	\item \texttt{swap (x,y)} example
\end{itemize}
