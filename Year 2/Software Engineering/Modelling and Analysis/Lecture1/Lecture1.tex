\underline{\huge The Role of Modelling}
\end{center}
\begin{defin}[Model]
	A model is something that provides an abstraction of a solution, capturing its essential characteristics and omitting unnecessary detail
\end{defin}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We use models to help produce solutions for both WSPs and also ISPs
\end{itemize}
\section{Why do we need to model?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Complexity and size of software products means we need abstractions (models) to help predict how desired characteristics will be realised in the actual product
	\item So we use models to support such activities as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requirements elicitation and specification
		\item Design of systems and applications
		\item Costing and planning
		\item Risk assessment
	\end{itemize}
	\item An important role for models in designing is that they help manage the cognitive load for large applications
\end{itemize}
\section{How do we develop a model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ideas about architecture can help with deciding what form of model we want to create
	\item Frameworks such as design patterns can help with organising the detailed structure of a model
\end{itemize}
\begin{important}[Models]
Creating models is an iterative process, we rarely get it right first time. It's a but like programming
\end{important}
\section{Perspectives and Viewpoints}
\begin{defin}[Perspective]
	Relates to a software development role. Each has their own set of interests and needs
\end{defin}

\begin{defin}[Viewpoint]
	A set of particular characteristics or attributes of a model, which in turn embody some specific aspect of software. A specific viewpoint is usually described by using one or more particular representations 
\end{defin}
\subsection{Design viewpoints}
\begin{itemize}
	\item An abstraction essentially "omits properties other than those of immediate interest"
	\item A viewpoint therefore focuses on a set of design attributes that relate to a particular abstraction
	\item The viewpoints we care about are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Constructional} - Describing static properties and constructional details
		\item \textbf{Behavioural} - Describing the casual links between events and system responses
		\item \textbf{Functional} - describing the operations performed
		\item \textbf{Data modelling} - describing the forms of data elements and the relations between them
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Software as an ISP}

\end{center}
\section{Interconnectedness}
The viewpoints can be considered to be "projections" of the model, and are not independent
\section{Representations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide the abstract descriptions we use in our models. A representation usually describes the attributes of the model that are related
\end{itemize}
