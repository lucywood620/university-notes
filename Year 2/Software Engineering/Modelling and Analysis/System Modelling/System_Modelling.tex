\end{center}
System modelling helps the analyst to understand the functionality of the system and models are used to communicate with customers\\
\\
Different models present the system from different perspectives
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{External} perspective showing the system's context or environment
	\item \textbf{Behavioural} perspective where you model the dynamic behaviour of the system and how it responds to events and processes data
	\item \textbf{Structural} perspective showing the system or data architecture
\end{itemize}
A model helps with getting an abstract idea of the objects that the software product will consist of and their interactions\\
\\
A model is easy to change\\
\\
Can be easily explained to non-technical audiences\\
\\
Can be used to measure against requirements
