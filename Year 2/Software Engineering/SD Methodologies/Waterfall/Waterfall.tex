\underline{\huge Waterfall Model}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Plan vs course change
	\item The waterfall model is often considered out of date
	\item Not an inflexible process but often created an inflexible instance (process vs people)
	\item Planning allows for more oversight and control
\end{itemize}
When to use:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Requirements very well documented, clear and fixed
	\item Product definition is stable
	\item Technology is understood and is not dynamic
	\item There are no ambiguous requirements
	\item Ample resources with required expertise are available to support the product
	\item The product is short
\end{itemize}
\section{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simple and easy to understand and use
	\item Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model. Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process
	\item Phases are processed and completed one at a time
	\item Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood
	\item Clearly defined stages
	\item Well understood milestones
	\item Easy to arrange tasks
	\item Process and results are well documented
	\item Iteration occurs within activities 
\end{itemize}
\section{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item No working software is produced until late during the life cycle
	\item High amounts of risk and uncertainty
	\item Not a good model for complex and object-oriented project
	\item Poor model for long and ongoing projects
	\item Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing. So, risk and uncertainty is high with this process model
	\item It is difficult to measure progress within stages
	\item Can't accommodate changing requirements
	\item Adjusting scope during the life cycle can end a project
	\item Integration is done as a "big-bang" at the very end, which doesn't allow identifying any technological or business bottleneck or challenges early
\end{itemize}
