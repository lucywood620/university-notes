Design as a verb - Relates to the design process\\
\\
Design as a noun - The form of the model or plan produced from the design process\\
\\
Technical debt - A form of risk, and one that needs to be recognised and managed when designing\\
\\
Designing involves using abstraction to help:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Model our design solution in terms of the essential aspects
	\item Separate the logical and physical aspects of a solution
	\item Make decisions where there are choices
\end{itemize}
The ultimate criterion for any decision should be fitness for purpose, in that a design should be well structures, should do its job well, and have no unnecessary features.
\section{Knowledge Schemas}
Schematic knowledge complements knowledge about the domain and about syntax and semantics, and relates to the way ideas about possible solutions are organised in memory.\\
\\
Schematic knowledge is typically transferred via:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Plan driven design methods
	\item Design patterns
	\item Software Architectures
\end{itemize}
\section{Some complications}
Significant problems that we encounter and must cope with when designing software are that
\begin{itemize}
	\item It has both static and dynamic characteristics
	\item We need to use static forms of description to model these characteristics
	\item Software is invisible, and so we have no intuitive ways of visualising its form or describing it diagrammatically 
\end{itemize}
\section{The outcomes of designing}
The outcome of the design process is usually in the form of a model or plan which can be used to guide the task of implementation, and that describes
\begin{itemize}
	\item The characteristics of the set of elements that will make up the "solution"
	\item Structure (how these elements are related to one another)
	\item How the elements will interact when the system is executed
\end{itemize}
The form of the model reflects the type of design elements we employ and is influenced by the choice of architectural style\\
\\
Plan driven approaches create much of the model before implementation begins, whereas for agile forms, the details of the model evolve dynamically.
\section{Architectural Style}
\textbf{Architectural style} - Concerned with a high-level concept of widely used structures and relationships.\\
\textbf{Architectural form} - Concerned with the high-level design of a particular system\\
\\
The concept helps analysis and understanding, but as with so many aspects of software, this has proved a difficult one to describe in a systematic manner
\subsection{What does software architecture do for us?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assists understanding, by giving a vocabulary that descries a system's high-level design
	\item Enables reuse of software, by identifying where we might "match" different system elements
	\item Aids system evolution, by exposing the dimensions along which a system is expected to evolve. The maintainers can use this as a guide as to how the system can best be executed
	\item Provides a framework for analysis - allowing us to assess how well the solution will meet user needs
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Classifying architectural style}
A simple and useful classification scheme is one based on the forms of the following three elements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Components: the basic building blocks used in a system built in this style
	\item Connectors: the way the components interact
	\item Context: how the elements and their interactions are organised and managed at run-time
\end{itemize}
The context can also be characterised in terms of other features of a system, sich as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Topology of information and control flow
	\item Synchronisation mechanisms
	\item Binding time
\end{itemize}
