\section{Large Scale Systems}
Ultra-large scale system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Considered not so much a "system" but an "ecosystem"
	\item 1000s of stakeholders
	\item Multiple user scenarios and requirements
	\item Continuous integration
	\item A wide variety of infrastructure and process integration
\end{itemize}
\section{Characteristics of large system development}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Collections of separate, communicating systems
	\item Separate teams develop each system
	\item Teams working in different places/time zones
	\item Include and interact with a number of existing systems
	\item Many system requirements concerned with the interaction with existing systems and so don't lend themselves to flexibility an incremental development
	\item Constrained by external rules and regulations limiting the way that they can be developed
	\item Long procurement and development time
	\item Difficult to maintain coherent teams over the development time as people move on
	\item Diverse set of stakeholders - can't involve them all in the development process
\end{itemize}
\section{Scaling agile methods}
Agile methods have been mostly used for small and medium sized projects that can be developed by a small co-located team. Success of these methods comes because of improved communications\\
\\
Scaling up agile methods involves changing these to cope with larger, longer projects where there are multiple development teams, perhaps working in different locations\\
\\
Scaling agile throughout an organisation
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multiple agile teams working on the same product
	\item Multiple agile teams working across different products
\end{itemize}
\section{Distributed Teams}
Create coherence
\begin{itemize}
	\item Acknowledge big and small cultural differences
	\item Strengthen functional and team subcultures
\end{itemize}
Change how you communicate
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cross-team communication mechanisms have to be designed and used. This should involve regular phone and video conferences between team members and frequent, short, electronic meetings where teams update each other on progress
	\item Initial and quarterly face to face meetings
	\item Stay together for as many iteration if possible
	\item Need more documentation - can't rely as much on talking
\end{itemize}
