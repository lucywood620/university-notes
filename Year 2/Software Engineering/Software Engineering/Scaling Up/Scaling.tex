\underline{\huge Scaling Up}
\end{center}
What is an ultra-large-scale system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item More an ecosystem than system
	\item 1000s of stakeholders
	\item Multiple user scenarios and requirements
	\item Continuous integration
	\item A wide variety of infrastructure and process integration
\end{itemize}
\section{Characteristics of large system development}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Collections of separate, communicating systems, where separate teams develop each system
	\item Development team spread over locations and timezones
	\item Include and interact with a number of existing systems
	\item Constrained by external rules and regulations limiting the way that they can be developed
	\item Long procurement and development time
	\item Diverse set of stakeholders
\end{itemize}
\section{Distributed teams}
Create coherence:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Acknowledge bit and small cultural differences
	\item Strengthen functional and team subcultures
\end{itemize}
Change how you communicate:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cross team communication mechanisms have to be designed and used. This should involve regular phone and video conferences and frequent electronic meetings
	\item Initial and quaterly face to face meetings
	\item Stay together for as many iterations as possible
	\item Need strong documentation
\end{itemize}
\section{Agile in large systems}
Some attributes significant in applying Agile to large projects are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Retain team sizes
	\item Iteration length
	\item Synchronised cadence
	\item Batch size
	\item Preserve PO and User role
\end{itemize}
\section{Scrum in large systems}
Scrum of Scrums:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A team member from each scrum regularly attends the scrum of scrums to coordinate work
\end{itemize}
Large scale scrum:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Team focused on the whole product instead of individual parts
	\item Only one sprint and backlog
	\item One overall product owner
\end{itemize}
\section{Problems of large system development}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project managers may be reluctant to accept the risk of a new development approach
	\item Quality procedures and standards that would be incompatible with agile methods
	\item Large range of skill levels in large organisations
	\item Cultural resistance to using agile
\end{itemize}
\section{Technical, human and organisational questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is it important to have a very detailed specification and design before moving to implementation
	\item Is an incremental delivery strategy realistic
	\item How large is the system being developed
	\item What type of system is being developed
	\item What is the expected system lifetime
	\item What technologies are available to support system development
	\item How is the development team organised
	\item Are there cultural or organisational issues that may affect the system development
	\item How good are the designers and programmers in the development team
	\item Is the system subject to external regulation
\end{itemize}
