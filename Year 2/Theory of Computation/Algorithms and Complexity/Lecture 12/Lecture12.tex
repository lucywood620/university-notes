\section{Flow networks, flow, maximum flow}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Material is transferred in a network from a "source" to a "sink"
	\item Source produces material at a steady rate, sink consumes at same rate
\end{itemize}
Edges have a given capacity\\
\\
Vertices (other than source/sink) are junctions
\begin{itemize}
	\item Material flows through them without collecting in them
	\item Entering rate = exiting rate
\end{itemize}
\section{Definitions}
\begin{defin}[Maximum-flow problem]
	We wish to compute the greatest possible rate of transportation from source to sink
\end{defin}

\begin{defin}[Flow network]
\begin{itemize}
	\item G=(V,E)
	\item Two distinguished vertices: source s and sink t
	\item Each edge $(u,v)\in E$ as non-negative capacity $c(u,v)\geqslant 0$
	\item If$(u,v)\notin E$, we assume $c(u,v)=0$
	\item For each $v\in V$, there is a path $s\rightarrow v \rightarrow t$
\end{itemize}
\end{defin}
\subsection{Flow constraints}
\begin{defin}[Capacity constraint]
	For all $u,v\in V$, we require $f(u,v)\leqslant c(u,v)$\\
	Flow from one vertex to another must not exceed given capacity
\end{defin}

\begin{defin}[Skew symmetry]
	For all $u,v\in V$, we require $f(u,v)=-f(v,u)$\\
	Flow from vertex u to vertex v is negative of flow in reverse direction
\end{defin}
\newpage
\begin{defin}[Flow conservation]
For all $u\in V - \{s,t\}$ we require
$$\sum_{c\in V}f(u,v)=0$$
Total flow out of a vertex is 0, likewise for total flow into a vertex (just saying what goes in, comes out), this doesn't apply to the source or drain
\end{defin}
\subsection{Total flows}
\begin{defin}[Total positive flow]
The total positive flow entering vertex v is
$$\sum_{u\in V: f(u,v)>0}f(u,v)$$
The total positive flow leaving vertex u is
$$\sum_{v\in V: f(u,v)>0}f(u,v)$$
\end{defin}

\begin{defin}[Total net flow]
	The total net flow at a vertex v is\\
	total positive flow leaving v - total positive flow entering v
\end{defin}

\begin{defin}[Flow value]
	The value of flow f is defined as the total flow leaving the source (and thus entering the sink)
	$$|f|=\sum_{v\in V}f(s,v)$$
	Note that $|\cdot|$ does not mean absolute value
\end{defin}
If there is an arrow only in one direction on the graph, then the capacity in the other direction is 0. There is no assumption of symmetric capacities.
\section{Technical tools}
\textbf{Implicit summation}\\
Let $X,T\subseteq V$. Then
\[
f(X, Y)=\sum_{x \in X} \sum_{y \in Y} f(x, y)
\]
