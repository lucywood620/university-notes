\section{Certificates}
Every yes-instance of an NP problem has a short and easily checkable certificate, for example an assignment for satisfiability
\begin{definition}[Certificate]
A potential solution, it may be correct or incorrect
\end{definition}
\section{Verifiers}
\begin{definition}[Verifier]
An acceptor machine (FSM with accepting states) V which halts on all inputs is called a verifier for a language $\mathcal{L}$ if
$$\mathcal{L}=\{w| V \text{accepts "w; c" for some string c}\}$$
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item w;c just means a problem certificate pair
	\item The string c is called a certificate (or witness) for w
	\item A verifier is said to be polynomial-time if it is a polynomial-time TM, and there is a polynomial $p(x)$ such that, for any $w\in \mathcal{L}$, there is a certificate c with $|c|\leqslant p(|w|)$
\end{itemize}
\section{The class NP}
\begin{definition}[NP]
	The class of languages that have polynomial-time verifiers is called NP	
\end{definition}
\begin{problem}[Composite Number]
\textbf{Instance} - A positive integer k\\
\textbf{Question} - Are there integers $u,v>1$ such that $u\cdot v=k$
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}[Subset Sum]
\textbf{Instance} - A collection of positive integers $S=\{a_1,...,a_k\}$ and a target integer t\\
\textbf{Question} - Is there a subset $T\subseteq S$ such that $\sum_{i\in T}a_i=t$
\end{problem}
\section{Problems (probably) not in NP}
\begin{problem}[No Hamiltonian Cycle]
\textbf{Instance} - A graph G\\
\textbf{Question} - Is it true that G has no Hamiltonian cycle?
\end{problem}
\begin{problem}[Checkers]
\textbf{Instance} - An integer n and a position in checkers on $n\times n$ board\\
\textbf{Question} - Is it a winning position for white?
\end{problem}
\section{Nondeterministic Machines}
We can get an alternative definition of the class NP by considering non-deterministic machines.\\
\\
Recall that if NT is a non-deterministic Turing Machine, then NT(x) denotes the tree of configurations which can be entered with input x, and NT accepts x if there is some accepting path in NT(x).
\begin{definition}[Time Complexity]
The time complexity of a non-deterministic Turing Machine NT is the function $NTime_{NT}$ such that $NTime_{NT}(x)$ is the number of steps in the shortest accepting path $NT(x)$ is there is one, otherwise it is the number of steps in the shortest rejecting path
\end{definition}
\section{Non-Deterministic time complexity}
\begin{definition}[Non-deterministic time complexity]
For any function f, we say that the non-deterministic time complexity of a decidable language $\mathcal{L}$ is $\mathcal{O}(f)$ is there exists a non-deterministic TM NT which decides $\mathcal{L}$, and constants $n_0$, and $c$ such that for all inputs $x$ with $|x|>n_0$
$$NTime_{NT}(x)\leqslant c\cdot f(|x|)$$
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Non-deterministic time complexity class]
The non-deterministic time complexity class NTIME[f] is defined to be the class of all problems (i.e. languages), for which there exists an algorithm with non-deterministic time complexity in $\mathcal{O}(f)$.
\end{definition}
\section{Alternative NP Definition}
\[
\mathrm{NP}=\bigcup_{k \geq 0} N T M E\left[n^{k}\right]
\]
Proof:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $\mathcal{L}\in NTIME[n^k]$, then there is a non-deterministic machine NT such that $x\in\mathcal{L}$ iff there is an accepting computation path in $NT(x)$. Furthermore, the length of these paths is $\mathcal{O}(|x|^k)$
	\item Using (some encoding of) these computation paths as the certificates, we can construct a polynomial time verifier for $\mathcal{L}$ which simply checks that each step of the computation path is valid
	\item Conversely, if $\mathcal{L}$ has a polynomial-time verifier V, then we can construct a non-deterministic machine that first "guesses" the value of the certificate, and then simulates V with that certificate
	\item Since the length of this certificate is polynomial in the length of the input, this machine is a non-deterministic-polynomial-time decision procedure for $\mathcal{L}$
\end{itemize}
\section{Complete Problems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Any complexity class can be partitioned into equivalence classes via polynomial time reduction - each class contains problems that are reducible to each other
	\item These equivalence classes are partially ordered by reduction
	\item Problems in the maximal class are called complete
\end{itemize}
\section{NP-completeness}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To show that $\mathcal{L}$ is NP-complete we must show that every language in NP can be reduced to $\mathcal{L}$ in polynomial time
	\item However once we have one NP-complete language $\mathcal{L}_0$, we can show any other language $\mathcal{L}$ is NP complete by showing that $\mathcal{L}_0\leqslant \mathcal{L}$
\end{itemize}
\section{Ladner's theorem}
\begin{theorem}
If $P\neq NP$ then NP contains infinitely many (polynomial time) inequivalent problems
\end{theorem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This implies that unless P=NP, the class NP contains (infinitely many) problems that are neither in P nor NP-complete. Such problems are called NP-intermediate
\end{itemize}
\section{Linear Programming}
\begin{problem}[Linear Programming]
\textbf{Instance}: Integer vectors $V_i=(v_1^i,...,v_n^i), 1\leqslant i\leqslant m, D=(d_1,...,d_n), C=(c_1,...,c_n)$ and an integer B\\
\textbf{Question}: Is there a rational vector $X=(x_1,...,x_n)$ such that $V_i\cdot X\leqslant d_i$ for all $1\leqslant i\leqslant m$ and such that $C\cdot X\geqslant B$
\end{problem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This is in P, but the same problems where X is required to be an integer vector is NP-complete
\end{itemize}
\section{Primes/composite}
\begin{problem}[Composite]
\textbf{Instance}: Positive integer K\\
\textbf{Question}: Is K composite?
\end{problem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Recently proven that it is in P
\end{itemize}
\section{Graph Isomorphism}
\begin{problem}[Graph Isomorphism]
\textbf{Instance}: Two undirected graphs $G=(V_G,E_G)$ and $H=(V_H,E_H)$\\
\textbf{Question}: Are G and H isomorphic, i.e., is there a bijection $f:V_G\rightarrow V_H$ such that $(u,v)\in E_G$ iff $(f(u),f(g))\in E_H$?
\end{problem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Currently the main candidate for NP-intermediate
\end{itemize}
