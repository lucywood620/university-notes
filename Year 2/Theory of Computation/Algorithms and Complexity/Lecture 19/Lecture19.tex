\underline{\huge Coping with Intractability}
\end{center}
If an optimisation problem is NP-hard we generally regard it as intractable\\
\\
We traditionally cope with this in the following ways
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Restrict the input
	\item Use heuristics
	\item Use approximation algorithms
	\item Random, fixed parameter, exact algorithms, average case etc
\end{enumerate}
\section{Restricting the input}
A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings
\begin{theorem}
	Every planar graph is 4-colourable
\end{theorem}
So 4 colouring is trivial for planar graphs, the answer is always yes
\begin{theorem}
3 colouring is NP complete for planar graphs
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Every triangle free planar graph is 3 colourable
\end{theorem}
Hence 3 colouring is trivial for triangle free planar graphs
\section{Using Heuristics}
A well know heuristic for colouring is first fit
\begin{itemize}
	\item Order the vertices of an n-vertex graph G as $v_1,...,v_n$
	\item Colour the vertices one by one in that order assigning the smallest available colour
	\item So, $v_i$ gets the smallest colour $x$ not used on $N(v_i)\cap\{v_1,...,v_{i-1}\}$ where $N(v_i)$ denotes the neighbourhood of $v_i$ in $G$
	\item Every tree is bipartite so can eb coloured with at most 2 colours
\end{itemize}
\section{Approximation algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
	\item An algorithm is a k-approximation if it always finds a solution that is a factor of k within the optimum
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Vertex cover}
Here is an approximation algorithm for vertex cover
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Approx-Vertex-Cover({G=(V,E)})]
C=$\varnothing$
E'=E(G)
while E'$\neq\varnothing$ do
	let (u,v) be an arbitrary edge of E'
	C=C$\cup${u,v}
	remove from E' every edge incident with either u or v
return C
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{theorem}
	The algorithm is a 2 approximation for vertex cover
\end{theorem}
\textbf{Proof}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let $C=\{u_1,v_1,u_2,v_2,...,u_p,v_p\}$ be the output, where the edges $(u_i,v_i)$ were chosen in executions of step 3, so $|C|=2p$
	\item By construction, $G-C$ has no edges so C is a vertex cover
	\item Let $C^*$ be a minimum vertex cover of G. As $(u_i,v_i)$ is an edge, at least one of $u_i,v_i$ belongs to $C^*$. So $|C^*|\geqslant p$. Hence $|C|=2p\leqslant 2|C^*|$
\end{itemize}
