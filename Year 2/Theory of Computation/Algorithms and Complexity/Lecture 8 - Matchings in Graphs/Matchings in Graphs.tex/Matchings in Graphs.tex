\section{Problem Definition}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph\\
\\
A set $M\subseteq E$ is a matching in G if no two edges in M have an end-vertex in common\\
\\
A matching M is maximum if there is no matching of G with more edges than M\\
\\
The matching number $\nu_G$ of G is the size of a maximum matching in G
\begin{defin}[Matching]
Instance: a graph G\\
Task: determine $\nu_G$
\end{defin}
\section{Alternating Paths and Cycles}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph and M be a matching inG\\
\\
A path P is alternating with respect to M iff among every two consecutive edges of P, exactly one edge belongs to M\\
\\
A cycle C is alternating with respect to M iff among every two consecutive edges of C, exactly one edge belongs to M.\\
\\
A vertex u is matched by a matching M is it is the end-vertex of an edge of M; otherwise u is unmatched by M\\
\\
For two sets A and B, the symmetric difference is the set
$$A\varnothing B = (A \backslash B)\cup (B \backslash A)$$
\textbf{Lemma}\\
Let G be a graph with a matching M and an alternating path P with respect to M. If each end-point of P is either unmatched by M or matched by $M\cap P$, then $M \varnothing P$ is another matching
